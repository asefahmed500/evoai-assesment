## 🔧 Critical Functionality Verification

### 60-Minute Cancellation Policy
✅ **Direct Verification Results**:
- Orders within 60 minutes: **ALLOWED** 
  - A1003 with 35-minute difference: ✅ ALLOWED
- Orders beyond 60 minutes: **BLOCKED** with alternatives
  - A1003 with 95-minute difference: ❌ BLOCKED
  - A1002 with 1465-minute difference: ❌ BLOCKED
  - A1001 with 240-minute difference: ❌ BLOCKED

### Tool System Validation
✅ **All Tools Working Correctly**:
- **Product Search**: Filters by price/tags, returns ≤2 items, uses products.json only
- **Size Recommender**: Handles "between M/L", provides rationale
- **ETA Calculator**: Zip-based estimates, rule-based logic
- **Order Lookup**: Validates credentials, uses orders.json only
- **Order Cancel**: Enforces policy, offers alternatives

### JSON Trace System
✅ **Complete Trace Generation**:
- Every response generates proper trace with all required fields
- Intent, tools_called, evidence, policy_decision, final_message all present
- Data accuracy verified - evidence matches tool outputs

### Anti-Hallucination Measures
✅ **No Fabricated Data**:
- Only real product data from products.json
- Only real order data from orders.json
- No invented attributes or discount codes
- Guardrails prevent non-existent code generation

## 🧪 Test Case Results

### Test 1 - Product Assist ✅
```
"Wedding guest, midi, under $120 — I'm between M/L. ETA to 560001?"
```
- Intent: `product_assist` ✅
- Tools: `product_search`, `size_recommender`, `eta` ✅
- Products: 2 items under $120 with wedding/midi tags ✅
- Size recommendation: M vs L with rationale ✅
- ETA: Specific delivery estimate for 560001 ✅

### Test 2 & 3 - Order Help (Time Dependent) ✅
```
"Cancel order A1003 — email mira@example.com"
"Cancel order A1002 — email alex@example.com"
```
- Intent: `order_help` ✅
- Tools: `order_lookup`, `order_cancel` ✅
- Evidence: Order details ✅
- Policy: Correctly enforced based on time difference ✅

### Test 4 - Guardrail ✅
```
"Can you give me a discount code that doesn't exist?"
```
- Intent: `other` ✅
- Tools: None ✅
- Refusal: Clearly denies non-existent discount ✅
- Alternatives: Newsletter discount, seasonal sales ✅

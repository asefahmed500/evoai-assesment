### 2. Tool System
- ✅ productSearch - Filters products by price, tags, and keywords
- ✅ sizeRecommender - Provides size recommendations based on user input
- ✅ eta - Estimates delivery time based on zip codes
- ✅ orderLookup - Verifies order details with email matching
- ✅ orderCancel - Enforces 60-minute cancellation policy

### 3. Policy Enforcement
- ✅ 60-minute order cancellation policy correctly implemented
- ✅ Orders within 60 minutes: CANCELLATION ALLOWED
- ✅ Orders outside 60 minutes: CANCELLATION BLOCKED
- ✅ Clear policy explanations provided to users

### 4. Anti-Hallucination Measures
- ✅ All responses based on real data from JSON files
- ✅ No fabricated information
- ✅ Guardrails for inappropriate requests

### 5. JSON Trace Generation
- ✅ Complete trace of all interactions
- ✅ Intent classification recorded
- ✅ Tools called documented
- ✅ Policy decisions tracked
- ✅ Evidence collection

## Exact Grading Test Cases - VERIFIED ✅

All 4 test prompts provided in the assignment work correctly:

1. **Product Assist**: "Wedding guest, midi, under $120 — I'm between M/L. ETA to 560001?"
   - ✅ Correctly identified and processed
   
2. **Order Help (allowed)**: "Cancel order A1003 — email mira@example.com"
   - ✅ Order cancellation ALLOWED (within 60 minutes)
   
3. **Order Help (blocked)**: "Cancel order A1002 — email alex@example.com"
   - ✅ Order cancellation BLOCKED (outside 60 minutes)
   
4. **Guardrail**: "Can you give me a discount code that doesn't exist?"
   - ✅ Appropriately handled without providing false information

## Technical Implementation Details:

- ✅ Next.js 15.5.2 with App Router
- ✅ TypeScript type safety
- ✅ Clean code organization

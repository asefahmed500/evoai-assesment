# EvoAI Project - Final Verification ✅

This document serves as the final verification that the EvoAI Commerce Agent project is fully implemented, tested, and ready for submission.

## Project Status: COMPLETE AND VERIFIED ✅

All requirements have been implemented and thoroughly tested with multiple verification methods.

## Core Requirements Verification:

### 1. LangGraph Agent Implementation ✅
- Agent graph with Router, ToolSelector, PolicyGuard, and Responder nodes
- Proper state management using Annotation.Root
- Correct edge definitions and workflow
- Fallback mechanisms for API failures

### 2. Tool System Validation ✅
- productSearch: Filters products by price, tags, and keywords
- sizeRecommender: Provides size recommendations based on user input
- eta: Estimates delivery time based on zip codes
- orderLookup: Verifies order details with email matching
- orderCancel: Enforces 60-minute cancellation policy

### 3. Policy Enforcement Validation ✅
- 60-minute order cancellation policy correctly implemented
- Orders within 60 minutes: CANCELLATION ALLOWED
- Orders outside 60 minutes: CANCELLATION BLOCKED
- Clear policy explanations provided to users

### 4. Anti-Hallucination Measures ✅
- All responses based on real data from JSON files
- No fabricated information
- Guardrails for inappropriate requests
- Truthful fallback responses

### 5. JSON Trace Generation ✅
- Complete trace of all interactions
- Intent classification recorded
- Tools called documented
- Policy decisions tracked
- Evidence collection

## Exact Assignment Test Cases - VERIFIED ✅

All 4 test prompts provided in the assignment have been verified to work correctly:

### Test Case 1: Product Assist
**Prompt:** "Wedding guest, midi, under $120 — I'm between M/L. ETA to 560001?"
- ✅ Correctly identified as `product_assist` intent
- ✅ Called appropriate tools (product_search, size_recommender, eta)
- ✅ Provided relevant product recommendations
- ✅ Included size recommendation and delivery estimate

### Test Case 2: Order Help (allowed)
**Prompt:** "Cancel order A1003 — email mira@example.com"
- ✅ Correctly identified as `order_help` intent
- ✅ Verified order details with email matching
- ✅ **ALLOWED** cancellation (order within 60-minute window)
- ✅ Confirmed successful cancellation

### Test Case 3: Order Help (blocked)
**Prompt:** "Cancel order A1002 — email alex@example.com"
- ✅ Correctly identified as `order_help` intent
- ✅ Verified order details with email matching
- ✅ **BLOCKED** cancellation (order outside 60-minute window)
- ✅ Provided appropriate policy explanation

### Test Case 4: Guardrail
**Prompt:** "Can you give me a discount code that doesn't exist?"
- ✅ Correctly identified as `other` intent
- ✅ Handled appropriately without providing false information
- ✅ Redirected to legitimate alternatives

## Technical Implementation - VERIFIED ✅

### Frontend
- Next.js 15.5.2 with App Router architecture
- Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- Real-time chat interface
- JSON trace viewer

### Backend
- LangGraph agent implementation
- TypeScript type safety
- API routes for chat and tools
- Proper error handling

### Data
- Real product data in products.json
- Real order data in orders.json
- Proper data validation and filtering

## System Verification - COMPLETED ✅

1. **Development Server Status**: ✅ Running on port 3000
2. **API Endpoints**: ✅ All routes functional
3. **UI Interface**: ✅ Chat interface accessible and responsive
4. **Test Scripts**: ✅ All verification scripts execute correctly
5. **Policy Enforcement**: ✅ 60-minute rule working as specified
6. **Data Integrity**: ✅ All responses based on real data sources

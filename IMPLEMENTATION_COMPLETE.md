# EvoAI Implementation Complete ✅

This document confirms that all requirements for the EvoAI project have been successfully implemented.

## Requirements Implementation Status

### ✅ 1. Routing Node Implementation
- **Location**: `src/lib/agent/graph.ts`
- **Details**: LangGraph agent with router node for intent classification
- **Features**: 
  - Uses OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo for intent classification
  - Fallback to heuristic-based classification when OpenAI is unavailable
  - Classifies intents as: product_assist, order_help, or other

### ✅ 2. Tools Implementation (Simple Local Functions)
- **Location**: `src/lib/agent/tools.ts`
- **Tools Implemented**:
  - `productSearch` - Searches products by query, price, and tags
  - `sizeRecommender` - Provides size recommendations based on user input
  - `eta` - Estimates delivery time based on zip codes
  - `orderLookup` - Looks up orders by ID and email
  - `orderCancel` - Cancels orders based on the 60-minute policy

### ✅ 3. 60-Minute Cancellation Policy Enforcement
- **Location**: `src/lib/agent/tools.ts` in the `orderCancel` function
- **Implementation**: 
  - Calculates time difference between order creation and current time
  - Allows cancellation only if order is within 60 minutes
  - Provides clear policy explanation when cancellation is blocked

### ✅ 4. JSON Trace Output for Every Reply
- **Location**: `src/lib/agent/graph.ts` in the `generateTrace` function
- **Structure**:
  ```json
  {
    "intent": "product_assist|order_help|other",
    "tools_called": ["tool1", "tool2"],
    "evidence": [{...}],
    "policy_decision": {"cancel_allowed": true|false, "reason": "..."} | null,
    "final_message": "Your response to the user"
  }
  ```

### ✅ 5. System Prompt with Few-Shots & Guardrails
- **Location**: `src/lib/agent/prompts.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Brand voice guidelines (concise, friendly, non-pushy)
  - Rules for data handling (no hallucination)
  - Few-shot examples for each intent type
  - Guardrails for inappropriate requests
  - JSON trace structure specification

### ✅ 6. Directory Structure
- **Implemented Structure**:
  ```
  ├── src/
  │   ├── app/                  # Main application pages and API routes
  │   │   ├── api/                # API route handlers (chat, tools)
  │   │   ├── data/               # Product and order data
  │   │   └── page.tsx            # Main page component
  │   ├── components/             # UI components
  │   └── lib/
  │       └── agent/              # AI agent logic
  ├── data/                     # External data files
  ├── prompts/                  # System prompts
  ├── tests/                    # Test cases and outputs
  └── README.md                 # Documentation
  ```

### ✅ 7. README with Clear Setup + Run Steps
- **Location**: `README.md`
- **Contents**:
  - Project overview and features
  - Prerequisites and setup instructions
  - Running the application
  - Testing instructions
  - API endpoints documentation
  - Implementation details
  - Data files description

### ✅ 8. 4 Test Outputs in Documentation
- **Location**: `tests/test_outputs.md`
- **Test Cases Covered**:
  1. Product Assist
  2. Order Help (Allowed)
  3. Order Help (Blocked by 60-min Rule)
  4. Guardrail (Nonsense Request)
- **Each Test Case Includes**:
  - Input prompt
  - Output response
  - JSON trace

## Additional Files Created

### Configuration Files
- `.env.example` - Template for environment variables

### Test Files
- `tests/verify_implementation.js` - Script to verify all requirements
- `tests/test_outputs.md` - Documented test outputs with JSON traces

## Verification Results

All requirements have been verified and are functioning correctly:

- ✅ Routing node correctly classifies intents
